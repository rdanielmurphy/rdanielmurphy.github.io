If you are an Android dev, chances are you will need to post screenshots or record video of your app. Well if you aren't using ADB to grab screen shots or record video of your phone, you really should be. I just discovered this recently but it's the quickest and easiest way to get screenshots to your computer.

## Install ADB

Obviously you will need ADB for this. So I'm going to assume you already have that installed.

## Open up Terminal

Open up a terminal and go to the directory you want to put your screenshots and videos.

### Screenshot

```bash
adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/screencap.png
adb pull /sdcard/screencap.png
```

### Video

```bash
adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/screen.mp4
adb pull /sdcard/screen.mp4
```

Press Ctrl-C to stop the video recording.

Set the bitrate like so (12MB):

```bash
adb shell screenrecord –bit-rate 12000000 /sdcard/screen.mp4
```
