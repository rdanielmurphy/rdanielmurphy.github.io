excerpt: "Just a post to give credit to some of the authors of the images I used."

Most of the pictures I am using as backgrounds at the top of the page/blog post are pictures of me or pictures taken by me. And all these pictures were taken while outside the country while traveling in various countries. At the bottom right I'll be adding a little note to say where it was taken. These aren't professional grade pictures by any means, as I'm not a photographer and I have no training whatsoever (and the pictures are taken using my phone), but I think it adds a unique touch to my site.

But sometimes I will be using background images that are free of use that I found online. Mostly for the Projects section. Here I will list the ones I used, post a link to the image, and credit the author when possible.
